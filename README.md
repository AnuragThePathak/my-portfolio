# Anurag Pathak

This is my portfolio website made with Nextjs and Tailwind CSS. It is hosted on [netlify](https://anuragpathak.netlify.app).

In case, you are using this site as a template for your own portfolio website, I would be really glad if you add a link to the original site with my name somewhere in your site.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
